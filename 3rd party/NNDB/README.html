Turner 1999

These are the set of nearest neighbor parameters for RNA folding compiled by the Turner group in 1999. The parameters are for estimating free energy changes at 37 ºC. Parameters are available for download in text format or html format. A description of the functional form and tutorials for use are available.

Turner 2004

These are the current set of nearest neighbor parameters for RNA folding compiled by the Turner group. Both free energy changes at 37 ºC and enthalpy changes have been estimated, allowing for structure prediction at arbitrary temperature. Parameters are available for download in text format or html format. A description of the functional form and tutorials for use are available.

A set of references to the literature of RNA optical melting experiments is available.

A help page that defines basic terms and provides tutorials for use of the parameters.

Purpose:
Nearest neighbor parameters for RNA folding are used widely in software packages, but no current published source exists to provide the parameters and a tutorial for their use. This database serves this function for the community and is intended to grow as the parameters are refined. The site will also be used to provide a historical record of parameter sets as they are subsequently refined.
