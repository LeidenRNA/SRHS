Contributions to LLVM are licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0, with two limited exceptions intended to ensure that LLVM is very permissively licensed. Collectively, the name of this license is “Apache 2.0 License with LLVM exceptions”. The exceptions read:

---- LLVM Exceptions to the Apache 2.0 License ----

As an exception, if, as a result of your compiling your source code, portions
of this Software are embedded into an Object form of such source code, you
may redistribute such embedded portions in such Object form without complying
with the conditions of Sections 4(a), 4(b) and 4(d) of the License.

In addition, if you combine or link compiled forms of this Software with
software that is licensed under the GPLv2 ("Combined Software") and if a
court of competent jurisdiction determines that the patent provision (Section
3), the indemnity provision (Section 9) or other Section of the License
conflicts with the conditions of the GPLv2, you may retroactively and
prospectively choose to deem waived or otherwise exclude such Section(s) of
the License, but only in their entirety and only with respect to the Combined
Software.
We intend to keep LLVM perpetually open source and available under a permissive license - this fosters the widest adoption of LLVM by allowing commercial products to be derived from LLVM with few restrictions and without a requirement for making any derived works also open source. In particular, LLVM’s license is not a “copyleft” license like the GPL.

The “Apache 2.0 License with LLVM exceptions” allows you to:

freely download and use LLVM (in whole or in part) for personal, internal, or commercial purposes.
include LLVM in packages or distributions you create.
combine LLVM with code licensed under every other major open source license (including BSD, MIT, GPLv2, GPLv3…).
make changes to LLVM code without being required to contribute it back to the project - contributions are appreciated though!
However, it imposes these limitations on you:

You must retain the copyright notice if you redistribute LLVM: You cannot strip the copyright headers off or replace them with your own.
Binaries that include LLVM must reproduce the copyright notice (e.g. in an included README file or in an “About” box), unless the LLVM code was added as a by-product of compilation. For example, if an LLVM runtime library like compiler_rt or libc++ was automatically included into your application by the compiler, you do not need to attribute it.
You can’t use our names to promote your products (LLVM derived or not) - though you can make truthful statements about your use of the LLVM code, without implying our sponsorship.
There’s no warranty on LLVM at all.
We want LLVM code to be widely used, and believe that this provides a model that is great for contributors and users of the project. For more information about the Apache 2.0 License, please see the Apache License FAQ, maintained by the Apache Project.

Note

The LLVM Project includes some really old subprojects (dragonegg, llvm-gcc-4.0, and llvm-gcc-4.2), which are licensed under GPL licenses. This code is not actively maintained - it does not even build successfully. This code is cleanly separated into distinct SVN repositories from the rest of LLVM, and the LICENSE.txt files specifically indicate that they contain GPL code. When LLVM transitions from SVN to Git, we plan to drop these code bases from the new repository structure.
